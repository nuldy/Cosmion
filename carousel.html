              <p>
                Mars, the fourth planet from the sun, is a cold and arid world known for its reddish appearance due to iron oxide on its surface. The planet features expansive deserts, towering volcanoes, and a canyon system, including the largest known canyon, Valles Marineris. Mars once had liquid water, evidenced by ancient river valleys and polar ice caps. Ongoing exploration seeks signs of past life and assesses the potential for future human colonization. Understanding Mars contributes to our broader knowledge of planetary evolution and the possibilities for extraterrestrial habitats.
